lixical_analyser.cpp file contain C++ to demonstrate basic syntax of LEX specifications, built in functions and Variables.

Lexical Analyzer for C++ language using LEX that should recognize identifiers, digits, operators, keywords, special symbols and white spaces and also supports error handling.

CFG to recognize an infix expression and implement a parser that recognizes the infix expression using YACC. Provide the details of all conflicting entries in the parser table generated by LEX and YACC and how they have been resolved Intermediate Code Generation

syntax analyzer : sample syntax Analyzer and implement the same for C++ language using YACC tool.  Syntax Analyzer should recognize syntax errors like Missing parenthesis, Missing semicolons etc.

An attributed translation grammar to recognize declarations of simple variables, "for", assignment, if, if - else statements as per syntax of C++or Pascal and generate equivalent three address code for the given input made up of constructs mentioned above using LEX and YACC. Write a code to store the identifiers from the input in a symbol table and also to record other relevant information about the identifiers. Display all records stored in the symbol table.

Regular expression and implement sample regular expression for c language. Design Regular Expression like (a/b)*ba(a/b)* - Implement above Regular Expression such that it should accept all the strings belong to that Regular Expression.
